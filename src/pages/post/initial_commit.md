So Iâ€™ve been struggling for a while now whether I should start a blog. In the end, I decided to set up this website, as I just wanted to try out, what it is like to have a blog. However, nothing happened afterwards. The reasons for this are quite simple. First, I feel like I donâ€™t like writing. But maybe this is caused by lots of reports, stories and documents I had to write during my time at school or university. Secondly, for me a blog is all about sharing (new) thoughts and ideas. But as Iâ€™m quite young, do I have any thoughts or opinions that are worth sharing?

A few months ago, I stumbled across <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/" class="underline" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this blog post</a> by Alexey Guzey. And if youâ€™re like me <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/#but-i-dont-have-anything-original-to-say-and-i-would-be-just-repeating-things-said-elsewhere-on-the-internet" class="underline" rel="noopener" target="_blank">section 4</a> might summarize your thoughts on starting a blog. Nevertheless, I still didnâ€™t start writing for no reason. It wasnâ€™t until I was sitting in a train on my way home that I just started to type these lines. I donâ€™t know what motivated to me to start, it might have been pure boredom, or I wanted to get rid of the item on my to-do list. Itâ€™s probably the latter :P
<br/>
<br/>
The point Iâ€™m trying to make is the following: if youâ€™re reading this, and you also think of starting an own blog, you might take these thoughts of a peer as your incentive to just start. There is a chance you end up in the same situation as I am right now, and you realize that writing can be quite enjoyable.

At this point I feel like it might be a good idea to tell you a bit more about myself. When writing things, I mostly struggle with transitions between different text sections. So Iâ€™m going to skip this part for now and jump right into it:

Hey there, Iâ€™m Luca and I really appreciate you reading these lines ðŸ˜„. Iâ€™m a German student in computer science, and Iâ€™m mainly interested in all the stuff around the web. This also includes JavaScript - sorry for everyone not enjoying JavaScript, I really do understand why you might not like it - but also all the frontend and backend related stuff, various web standards and especially software architecture. I generally have too little time for too many things I want to get into ðŸ˜¬.
<br/>
<br/>
As you might have guessed, this blog will be mainly about exactly these topics - tech things. Maybe Iâ€™ll put some other ideas on here too, like about fitness (my second great love) or just random thoughts. Weâ€™ll see. 

Iâ€™m also thinking of providing a way of communication like comments. However, as this is currently missing, you can just raise an issue on the <a href="http://github.com/cuvar/blog" class="underline" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repo</a> for the blog or email me to <a href="mailto:info@cuvar.dev" class="underline">my email</a>. Even if you have thoughts on any mistakes I made related to the topic or the language, please donâ€™t be afraid of contacting me. 

I hope you enjoyed this introductory post. Hopefully, see you soon!
<br/>
<br/>
\- Luca
